## Notes

- In my university coursework, I've mostly been working with Python, so switching back and forth between JavaScript and Python was challenging remembering specific syntax and nuances of each langugage.
- Adding the searchbar functionality was a fun challenge. Being able to reuse the addGamesToPage function to my search functions was a lightbulb moment and overall was a helpful exercise to complete another feature without the steps to complete the challenges provided.
